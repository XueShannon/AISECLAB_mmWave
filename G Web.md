# G Web


G web is also a computer language, but the difference is that it represented by images, so like other languages, it has the most important loop and judgment syntax, but unlike general computer languages, G web is a Graphical language for describing hardware connections. Therefore, there are relatively different ways of using variables in the definition and use of variables.



## Control References

This is special type just like pointer in C. We can use this to change the attribute very esay. Just like using pointer to change the specific class object in C.


## Signal Modulation

For modulation modules, the bit stream required by all modules is not a special data type of g web, but represents 0 and 1 through `I8` , an 8-bit signed integer. The one-dimensional array composed of this signed integer is called a bit stream.

Since g web only provides a part of the modulation modules, the specific functions can only be used through further learning.[ASK Modulation and Demodulation using Labview2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5m7Y4H8jtA)

## TDMS File Format
Labview use a TDMS style to store the data. So we can store the data of signal to TDMS File and then read whenever we want.[TDMS FILE Introduction](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/documentation/supplemental/06/the-ni-tdms-file-format.html)
